# Vulnerous-web
A web app vulnerability scanner.
Vulnerous-web is a cross platform command line tool that works as an auditor, logger, tool aggregator and report generator for performing VAPT analysis of any given website.Websites experience 22 attacks per day on average— that’s over 8,000 attacks per year. A website vulnerability is a weakness or misconfiguration in a website or web application code that allows an attacker to gain some level of control of the site, and possibly the hosting server. Vulnerous web helps in minimizing vulnerability analysis effort by providing 80 tests of OWASP top 10 and more such vulnerabilities for every web app.
